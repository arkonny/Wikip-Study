# WikipStudy

A web app to learn from Wikipedia !  
Wikipedia is the largest source of knowledge openly accessible on the internet.  
What if you could learn easily from it ?  
That's the mission of WikipStudy !  

![WikipStudy Logo](/wikipstudy_logo.png)  

## Objectives :
- Learn anything (available on Wikipedia, of course)
- Generate lesson from a page automatically 
- Learn with fun, or at least learning shouldn't feel like a chore
- Follow courses, or a kind of roadmap of what you want to learn
- Community driven, like Wikipedia (to create courses and help to correct lessons)
- Possibility to use it as a game
- Multiplayer
- Accessible (respect of WAI from W3C)
- Be quick and easy to launch
- Both fun and useful

 ### Usable for different purposes :
- fast learning
- in-depth learning and verification of what you actually understood and remember
- learning in group
- having fun

## Quizz Sessions
### Principle :
A user can launch a quizz session, giving him multiple questions on a pre-selected subject.  
The questions can be of various nature : multiple-choice, fill-in, date an event, locate a place on a map (from a photo or the name of the place), write some code, solve a math problem...  
Of course, there can be different levels, either a general level for all the questions, or a personnalized one for specific type of questions where you are bored.  
A subject is (for now) a page, but this could be given a larger scale of thematics, being a group of pages determined either by the user himself (a private thematic) or more commonly by the community (a public thematic) (eg. The history of Mathematics, a thematic that could regroup pages of famous mathematicians and their discoveries)  

### Personnalisation :
Presets are available to launch a quick game : general culture (easy, normal or hard, to play a quick game), [select category] (difficulty level, for specific themes), and many others more, created by the community for example. (famous people, cities, famous events, etc)  
There can be auto-generated presets for particular pages, when you launch it from a course or a category  
However, if you have a specific idea, you can use the parameters : select a range of time or a range of geographic space, types of questions (dates, geography, images, math, code, fill-in, multiple-choice etc.), themes, categories or pages you want, and randomization possibilities for all of this (random type of questions, random theme etc.)  

## Focus group :
This app has multiple use case, so almost anyone could be interested in using it, including :  
~~Someone excited to learn about a specific subject available on Wikipedia~~  
Someone or a group of friends who wants to play a knowledge game  
Focusing on the "fun" potential of the app, to emphasize on users interactions and developping a game is always more engaging than a boring app
