## Quizz Sessions
### Principle :
A user can launch a quizz session, giving him multiple questions on a displayed theme.
The questions can be of various nature : multiple-choice, fill-in, date an event, locate on a map (from a photo or the name of a place), write some code, solve a math problem...
Of course, there can be different levels, either a general level for all the questions, or a personnalized one for specific type of questions where you are bored.

### Personnalisation :
Presets are available to launch a quick game : general culture (easy, normal or hard, to play a quick game), [select category] (difficulty level, for specific themes), and many others more, created by the community for example. (famous people, cities, famous events, etc)
There can be auto-generated presets for particular pages, when you launch it from a course or a category
However, if you have a specific idea, you can use the parameters : select a range of time or a range of geographic space, types of questions (dates, geography, images, math, code, fill-in, multiple-choice etc.), themes, categories or pages you want, and randomization possibilities for all of this (random type of questions, random theme etc.)

### Goals :
- Possibility to use it as a game
- Usable for different purposes :
    - fast learning
    - in-depth learning and verification
    - learning in group
    - having fun
    - multiplayer one device
    - multiplayer multi device
    - multiplayer one device/player
- accessibility (respect of WAI from W3C)
